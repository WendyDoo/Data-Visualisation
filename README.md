# Data_Visualisation
"Hello World" 🕵🏻

This is my personal project using Shiny R to visualise datasets. The project is about analysing Crime and Alcohol-specific deaths
analysis before and during the Coronavirus pandemic in England and Wales. 


Three main questions would be answered in this visualisation project:

Question 1: What is the relationship between the number of crimes and the number of alcohol- specific deaths before and during the coronavirus pandemic in England and Wales? 

Question 2: How are the number of crimes and the number of alcohol-specific deaths different by regions in England and Wales?

Question 3: Does the increase in coronavirus cases affect the number of alcohol-specific deaths?
